A web app for a 2023 research study within the Department of Psychology at York University. The focus of the study is the exploration of improved learning outcomes for undergraduate students taking statistics. Participants will be randomly split into 2 groups - Group A or Group B - and asked to complete learning modules that would teach them statistical methods.

- Those in Group A would view custom built high quality animations.
- Those in Group B would view custom made high quality infographics.
